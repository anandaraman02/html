# HTML Project Tutorial - Event Page, Tables, and Forms
Welcome to the HTML Project Tutorial repository! This repository contains the starter and final code for two complete projects that will be covered in a YouTube tutorial series. The tutorial series aims to provide comprehensive knowledge about HTML and guide you through building two exciting projects: an Event Page and a project focused on Tables and Forms.

#Project 1: Event Page
In the first project, we will build an Event Page that will cover a wide range of fundamental HTML components. Throughout this project, you will learn how to use the following HTML elements:

Heading Tags: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
Paragraph Tags: <p>
Anchor Tags: <a>
Body Tag: <body>
HTML Boilerplate: <html>
Image Tag: <img>
By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to structure basic HTML elements and create an appealing Event Page.
#Project 2: Tables and Forms
In the second project, we will dive deeper into HTML by focusing on two important components: Tables and Forms. Tables are used to present data in a structured format, while forms are essential for user input and data submission. Throughout this project, you will learn to use the following HTML elements:

Table Tag: <table>
Table Row Tag: <tr>
Table Header Cell Tag: <th>
Table Data Cell Tag: <td>
Form Tag: <form>
Input Tags: <input> (various types), <textarea>, <select>, <option>, <label>, <button>
By the end of this project, you will be proficient in creating tables and forms, and you'll understand how to collect user input and process it.
